gatherHotelPreferences
A CLI application that uses LLM interaction to determine customer hotel preferences through a guided questionnaire. The system generates search terms (both traditional and vector-based) from customer responses to recommend hotels based on web-scraped reviews and other unstructured data.

ðŸ†• NEW: Claude AI Expert Analysis
The system now includes breakthrough psychological analysis powered by Claude Sonnet 4!

After gathering your preferences and finding real hotels with pricing, Claude provides:

Reading between the lines of your conversation
Brutally honest budget reality checks
Psychological insights about your travel motivations
Practical pros/cons for realistic options
Uncomfortable questions you should ask yourself
Example Analysis:

"You're romanticizing Aspen but have never actually priced out a real trip there. Your $547 budget captures exactly 1 out of 30 available properties. You're essentially asking for a Ferrari experience with a Honda budget."

Python-based CLI application with fixed input handling (no more backspace bugs!)
Integration with local LLM (Ollama) for conversation analysis
6 strategic questions to elicit detailed customer preferences
Real hotel search with live pricing from Booking.com API

Example Claude Analysis Output
## READING BETWEEN THE LINES
What they're really telling me: You're a skiing enthusiast who's romanticized Aspen but has never actually priced out a real trip there. Your desire for a pool "to rest weary bones" suggests you're either older, out of shape, or anticipating being completely destroyed by Colorado skiing.

The contradiction that reveals everything: You budgeted $547/night for "midrange" in Aspen during peak season, but the actual search results show only ONE option under $550. This massive gap between expectation and reality suggests you're completely inexperienced with luxury destination pricing.

## REALITY CHECK: YOUR BUDGET VS ASPEN
The math: Your $547 budget captures exactly 1 out of 30 available properties. You're essentially asking for a Ferrari experience with a Honda budget.

## HONEST RECOMMENDATIONS
### Option 1: Face Reality - St. Moritz Lodge ($164/night)
**Why this is actually perfect for you:** This is your only option within budget, and it might save you from financial regret while still letting you say you "stayed in Aspen."

**PROS:**
- You can actually afford it without credit card debt
- 8.7 rating means it's genuinely decent, not a dump
- Leaves budget for ski lessons and equipment

**CONS:**
- Zero prestige factor - this isn't Instagram-worthy luxury
- Might not have the pool you specifically mentioned wanting

Change vector embedding approaches
Add new hotel search providers
Extend Claude analysis with new psychological frameworks
Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Input/Backspace Problems:

âœ… FIXED: Replaced Rich Prompt with pure Python input()
API Key Issues:

bash
# Check if keys are set
echo $RAPIDAPI_KEY
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Set them if missing
export RAPIDAPI_KEY="your_key_here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"
Ollama Connection:

bash
# Make sure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Test connection
ollama list
Claude Analysis Fails:

Check API key is set correctly
Verify internet connection
Try the test script: python test_claude_integration.py
No Hotels Found:

Verify RAPIDAPI_KEY is set
Check destination spelling
Try different date ranges
